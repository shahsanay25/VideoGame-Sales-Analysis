# VideoGame-Sales-Analysis
The video game industry is at the peak of an exciting evolution. These games have been around for decades, providing entertainment for any given age group. They have significantly evolved from the early days of computer games to the latest complex platforms. The Data provided in our project is a combination of 3 datasets based on Video Games Sales. 

<br/>The data can be described by the Name of the video games, their publishers, the platforms on which they are played, Genre classification, the regional sales mainly in North America, Europe and Japan, the Critic and User Scores etc. 

<br/>Through this project we have attempted to apply the learnt concepts of Probability, Cluster Analysis, Text Analysis and Time Series Analysis to gain an in-depth understanding of the sales trends undertaken by companies to target its audience.
